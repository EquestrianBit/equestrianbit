Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the EquestrianBit
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/EquestrianBit/equestrianbit/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of EquestrianBit.
